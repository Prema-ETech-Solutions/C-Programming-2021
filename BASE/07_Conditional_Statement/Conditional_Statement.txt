What is a Conditional Statement in C?
Conditional Statements in C programming are used to make decisions based on the conditions. 
Conditional statements execute sequentially when there is no condition around the statements. 
If you put some condition for a block of statements, 
the execution flow may change based on the result evaluated by the condition. 
This process is called decision making in ‘C’.
In ‘C’ programming conditional statements are possible with the help of the following two constructs:
1. If statement

2. If-else statement

It is also called as branching as a program decides which statement to execute based on the result of the evaluated condition.

If statement
It is one of the powerful conditional statement. 
If statement is responsible for modifying the flow of execution of a program. 
If statement is always used with a condition. 
The condition is evaluated first before executing any statement inside the body of If. 
The syntax for if statement is as follows:
